/* Student Grade Analyzer
Create a C++ program that analyzes the grades of five students. 
The program should use a fixed-size array to store the grades and implement 
two user-defined functions: one to calculate the average grade and another 
to count how many students passed, with a passing mark defined as 75 or higher. 
After processing, the program should display all the grades, the computed average, 
and the total number of passers. Students must use standard array indexing and 
avoid dynamic memory allocation or pointers. For an additional challenge, 
they may modify the program to allow the user to re-enter a new set of five grades 
and repeat the analysis.

goal 1: calculate avg grade
goal 2: count passer
goal 3: display grades
